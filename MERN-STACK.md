1- MERN is the acronym for MongoDB, Express JS, React JS and Node JS. The MERN stack is a combination of the above technologies, all based on JavaScript, used to build advanced web applications. It is an open source full stack development framework i.e. it provides entire front-end to back-end development components. While MongoDB, Express JS and Node JS are the common components (between MEAN and MERN); Angular JS is replaced by React JS in MERN.

 2 -MongoDB: MongoDB is an open source, cross platform, NoSql DBMS.

   -it is a document oriented database, which means that data is saved using collections and documents, instead of tables and rows, like in a relational database. This makes possible easier and faster data integration within applications.

   -MongoDB stores the data in binary JSON format that allows the fast exchange of data between client and server.

   -MongoDB can be used for the storage of large volumes of data, which makes it highly scalable.
    
 3 -Express JS- Express JS is a modular, lightweight framework of the Node JS, that helps in building web applications.

   -It is a server side, back-end, JavaScript based framework, that is designed to write simplified, fast and secure applications.

   -It can be assumed that Express JS, runs on top of the Node JS, managing the server and its routes.

 4 -React JS-React JS is an open source JavaScript library used to build user interfaces, typically for single page applications.

   -React JS enables developers to modify/edit and refresh the page to view the changes without having to restart or reload the page.

   -React JS offers the facility of code reusability on multiple platforms.

   -It is fast and scalable.

 5 -Node JS-Node JS is an open-source, cross platform, JavaScript runtime environment.

   -It is designed to run the JavaScript code outside the browser, on the server side.

   -Node JS accesses the Node Package Manager (NPM), that hosts a large number of private and public packages, and is as well utilized for publishing Node JS projects.

   -It is based on the event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.
